              <hr>
              <p>The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a pseudoscientific introspective personality test indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The MBTI was constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers and they based it on the theory that was proposed by Carl Jung. He had speculated that people experience the world using four principal psychological functions – sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking – and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time.
                  <p>The four categories are Introversion/Extroversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving. Each person is said to have one preferred quality from each category, producing 16 unique types.</p>
                    The underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we interpret our experiences, and these preferences underlie our interests, needs, values, and motivation.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The MBTI is the most popular personality test in the world. More than two million people take it every year. It is used in twenty-six countries to assess employees, students, soldiers, and potential marriage partners. It is used by Fortune 500 companies and universities, in self-improvement seminars and wellness retreats.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p>The first pair of psychological preferences is Extraversion and Introversion. It analyses if a person likes to spend time in the outer world of people and things, or in their inner world of ideas and images.</p>
                  <h5>Extraversion (E)</h5>
                  <p>Extroverts get their energy from active involvement in events and having a lot of different activities. They are excited when they are around people and like to energize other people. They are usually trying to make things happen by moving into action. They often understand a problem better by being very vocal about it and hear what others have to say.</p>
                  <h5>Introversion (I)</h5>
                  <p>Introverts get their energy from dealing with the ideas, pictures, memories, and reactions that are in their thoughts, in their inner world. They often prefer doing things alone or with one or two people with whom they are comfortable with. They usually decide to act only after they have taken the time to clearly reflect on their course of action.</p>  
                  <br>

                  <p>The second pair of psychological preferences is Sensing and Intuition. It is based on whether a person pays more attention to information that comes in through the five senses, or to the patterns and possibilities they see in the information that is presented?</p>
                  <h5>Sensing (S)</h5>
                  <p>Paying attention to physical reality, what I see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. I'm concerned with what is actual, present, current, and real. I notice facts and I remember details that are important to me. I like to see the practical use of things and learn best when I see how to use what I'm learning. Experience speaks to me louder than words.</p>
                  <h5>Intuition (N)</h5>
                  <p>Paying the most attention to impressions or the meaning and patterns of the information I get. I would rather learn by thinking a problem through than by hands-on experience. I'm interested in new things and what might be possible, so that I think more about the future than the past. I like to work with symbols or abstract theories, even if I don't know how I will use them. I remember events more as an impression of what it was like than as actual facts or details of what happened.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p>This third preference pair describes how you like to make decisions. Do you like to put more weight on objective principles and impersonal facts (Thinking) or do you put more weight on personal concerns and the people involved (Feeling)?</p>
                  <h5>Thinking (T)</h5>
                  <p>When I make a decision, I like to find the basic truth or principle to be applied, regardless of the specific situation involved. I like to analyze pros and cons, and then be consistent and logical in deciding. I try to be impersonal, so I won't let my personal wishes--or other people's wishes--influence me.</p>
                  <h5>Feeling (F)</h5>
                  <p>I believe I can make the best decisions by weighing what people care about and the points-of-view of persons involved in a situation. I am concerned with values and what is the best for the people involved. I like to do whatever will establish or maintain harmony. In my relationships, I appear caring, warm, and tactful.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p>This fourth preference pair describes how you like to live your outer life--what are the behaviors others tend to see? Do you prefer a more structured and decided lifestyle (Judging) or a more flexible and adaptable lifestyle (Perceiving)? This preference may also be thought of as your orientation to the outer world.</p>
                  <h5>Judging (J)</h5>
                  <p>I use my decision-making (Judging) preference (whether it is Thinking or Feeling) in my outer life. To others, I seem to prefer a planned or orderly way of life, like to have things settled and organized, feel more comfortable when decisions are made, and like to bring life under control as much as possible.</p>
                  <h5>Perceiving (P)</h5>
                  <p>I use my perceiving function (whether it is Sensing or Intuition) in my outer life. To others, I seem to prefer a flexible and spontaneous way of life, and I like to understand and adapt to the world rather than organize it. Others see me staying open to new experiences and information.</p>
