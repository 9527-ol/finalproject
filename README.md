# Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Machine Learning Model

Personality as defined by the American Psychological Association (https://www.apa.org/topics/personality) refers to individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving. The study of personality focuses on two broad areas: One is understanding individual differences in particular personality characteristics, such as sociability or irritability. The other is understanding how the various parts of a person come together as a whole.

This project was designed to predict the personality of a person based on user inputs.

Various Machine Learning algorithms were used to find the best predictive accuracy and then was designed into an interactive webpage that has been hosted through Heroku.
